# Shiny with python

A shiny app is composed of two elements:

1. User Interface: Defines a set of inputs and outputs widgets are displayed in the page.
2. Server: Defines the mapping of the input to the output widgets. It is a function that receives the `input` from 
   the UI and generates the `output`.
